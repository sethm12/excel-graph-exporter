## Overview

Chart Exporter is a custom Excel add-in that fully automates the process of exporting charts from Excel into PowerPoint presentations. What previously required manually copying each chart, switching to PowerPoint, pasting, resizing, and repositioning — repeated for every chart across every report — is now done in seconds with a few clicks.

**Estimated time savings: ~99% reduction in manual effort per reporting cycle.**

For teams that produce recurring reports with Excel charts, this eliminates one of the most tedious parts of the reporting process entirely. A task that could take 30–60+ minutes per report, depending on chart count, is reduced to under a minute — without any loss in output quality. Across weekly or monthly reporting cycles, that compounds into hours of recovered time per person, per month.

## Features

- **Bulk chart export** — select any combination of charts from any worksheets in a workbook and export them all in one run, rather than one at a time
- **Works with files or live presentations** — export directly into a PowerPoint template on disk to generate a fresh report, or inject charts into a presentation you already have open
- **Guided selection interface** — a clean step-by-step UI walks the user through picking which sheets to scan, which charts to include, and where they should go; no PowerPoint knowledge required
- **Dual slide layout support** — charts can be assigned to different slide layouts (including a specialized "Resolution Scaling" layout) from within the same workflow, with no extra steps
- **Smart destination detection** — if multiple PowerPoint files are open at once, the tool automatically asks which one to target instead of guessing
- **Pixel-perfect placement** — charts are automatically resized and repositioned to fit the correct slide placeholder exactly, so slides look publication-ready with no manual adjustments
- **Template-based system** — works in conjunction with a custom-built PowerPoint template, creating a complete and repeatable end-to-end reporting workflow
