## Overview

Graph Exporter is a custom Excel add-in that fully automates the process of exporting graphs from Excel into PowerPoint presentations. What previously required a painstaking manual process — repeated for every single graph across every report — is now done in seconds with a few clicks.

**Time savings: ~99% reduction in process time, approximately 30 minutes per project.**

To illustrate what the old workflow actually looked like: for every graph, a team member had to copy it from Excel, switch to PowerPoint, paste it, resize it to match the slide's aspect ratio, reduce it to 80% of its original size, center it on the slide, and finally remove its background. Multiplied across a workbook full of graphs spread across multiple sheets, this added up to hundreds of individual actions per report. Graph Exporter reduces that entire process to a few clicks.

For teams that produce recurring reports with Excel graphs, this eliminates one of the most tedious parts of the reporting process entirely — and unlike the manual process, removes the risk of human error entirely.

## Features

- **Bulk graph export** — select any combination of graphs from any worksheets in a workbook and export them all in one run, rather than one at a time
- **Works with files or live presentations** — export directly into a PowerPoint template on disk to generate a fresh report, or inject charts into a presentation you already have open
- **Guided selection interface** — a clean step-by-step UI walks the user through picking which sheets to scan, which graphs to include, and where they should go; no PowerPoint knowledge required
- **Dual slide layout support** — graphs can be assigned to different slide layouts (including a specialized "Resolution Scaling" layout) from within the same workflow, with no extra steps
- **Smart destination detection** — if multiple PowerPoint files are open at once, the tool automatically asks which one to target instead of guessing
- **Pixel-perfect placement** — graphs are automatically resized and repositioned to fit the correct slide placeholder exactly, so slides look publication-ready with no manual adjustments
- **Template-based system** — works in conjunction with a custom-built PowerPoint template, creating a complete and repeatable end-to-end reporting workflow
